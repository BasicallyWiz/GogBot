# Gog Gogcord
This file and all other files in the Markdown folder are meant to be used in an app called __Obsidian__. It's free. Download it.

==If you are to open this in Obsidian, open the root folder, "GogBot", to avoid creating an obsidian directory in more folders.==

### [Obsidian Admonition](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-admonition)
```ad-note 
title: Admonition Demo
collapse: open

With Admonition installed, this is a collapseable note!
```

## Some Notes
```ad-note Graph View
In Graph view, [[Documentation]] doesn't reference many files, due to the file references being in the embedded search queries. Graph view does not detect these Queries.
```

[^fuuuuck]: I had to open my touch keyboard for this.
