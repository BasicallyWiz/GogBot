## What in Sam hell is this?
A discord bot written in C# (now.), using Discord.Net, because it's horrible practice to make my own dotnet RESTful library, if someone's done it already. "But so many people have made better discord bots than this!" Bruh momentum.

## If you're seeing this, hi!
GogBot is having a little bit of a mental struggle about uselessness, so I'm reprogramming it from the ground up. Again.

GogBot's life dream has been to be properly object-oriented in C#, but was born from the grubby [normal-sized] hands of someone who was too stupid to actually understand what object oriantation means. This meant GogBot now has to go Trans, or it will probably kill it's own task.

I'm also making plans and researching _before_ I do the stupid.

GogBot 3.0 moment?
